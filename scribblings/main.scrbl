@bold{Note:} The HTML renderer of your browser may not render verbatim unicode optimally.
A better rendering will often be obtained in a fixed-size programming editor.
In DrRacket, to avoid intermediate blank pixel lines, uncheck
@tt{Edit|Preferencesâ€¦|Editing|General Editing|Add one pixel of extra space between lines}.

You can also copy/paste unicode outputs @hyperlink["https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GS5GOG5AUN8G"]{here} for a (usually) good preview.
